# Houseplant App â€“ Full Stack Interin Assessment

## Project Description

This full-stack web application was built as part of a **Fullstack Intern Assessment** to demonstrate practical skills in **Python (FastAPI)** and **React**. It allows users to browse houseplants in a searchable, filterable table and view detailed information for each plant.


---
## Requirements Covered

### Frontend

**Frontend:**
- Table view with search and category filter
- Detailed plant info page with image
- Navigation between list and detail views
- State management with Redux Toolkit
- Responsive UI with Tailwind CSS

**Backend:**
- FastAPI server as a proxy to RapidAPI
- `/plants` and `/plants/{plant_id}` endpoints
- CORS enabled for frontend requests
- Error handling and status codes
- Unit tests for both main routes

---


## Approach

### Frontend

- **State Management:** Uses Redux Toolkit for global plant data; UI state (search/filter) is local.
- **API Integration:** Fetches data from the backend, which in turn uses the RapidAPI houseplants API.
- **Modular Components:** Table, search bar, filter, detail view, etc.
- **Routing:** Uses React Router for navigation between table and detail pages.
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS for responsive and modern UI.

### Backend

- **FastAPI:** Python backend serving as a proxy to the RapidAPI houseplants API.
- **/plants Route:** Returns all plants in simplified form (only required fields).
- **/plants/<plant_id> Route:** Returns detailed info for a single plant.
- **CORS:** Implemented to allow frontend requests.
- **Error Handling:** Returns appropriate status codes and error messages.
- **Unit Testing:** Includes a test for both routes.

## Resources Used

- [FastAPI ](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)
- [React ](https://react.dev/)
- [Redux Toolkit ](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)
- [Tailwind CSS ](https://tailwindcss.com/)

## Time Spent
This project was completed over the course of approximately 2â€“3 days.
Most of the time was dedicated to building the application from the ground up, ensuring that both the frontend and backend were fully functional, well-structured, and aligned with all assessment requirements in an efficient and reliable way.

## How to Run the App
### ðŸ“¦ Backend (FastAPI)

1. **Navigate to the backend folder:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
2. **Create a `.env` file with your RapidAPI credentials:**  
   ```
   RAPIDAPI_KEY=your_rapidapi_key
   RAPIDAPI_HOST=house-plants2.p.rapidapi.com
   ```
3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Start the backend server:**
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```
5. **Access the API at:**  
   [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

---

### ðŸ’» Frontend (React)

1. **Navigate to the frontend folder:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. **Access the app at:**  
   [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

## Notes

- The backend acts as a proxy to the RapidAPI houseplants API, simplifying and securing data for the frontend.
- CORS is enabled in the backend to allow requests from the frontend.
- Plant data is managed globally in Redux; UI state is kept local for efficiency.
- Error handling is consistent across frontend and backend.
- The codebase is modular, clean, and ready for future enhancements.
